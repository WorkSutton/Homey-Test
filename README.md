## Task

Use Ruby on Rails to build a project conversation history. A user should be able to:

- leave a comment
- change the status of the project

The project conversation history should list comments and changes in status. 

Please donâ€™t spend any more than 3 hours on this task.

## Brief

Treat this as if this was the only information given to you by a team member, and take the approach you would normally take in order to build the right product for the company.

To this extent:

- Please write down the questions you would have asked your colleagues
- Include answers that you might expect from them
- Then build a project conversation based on the answers to the questions you raised.

## Tech Stack
- Ruby 3.2.2
- Rails 7.0.5
- Postgresql 15
- Docker + Docker Compose
- Shell scripts

## Setup to run locally

Detailed information on how to setup locally with Docker and Docker compose are contained in the document [Docker Development + Local Setup](docs/docker-local-setup.md)

The only prerequisites for running/developing locally are install the approriate version of Docker + Docker Compose. Instructions for this are linked in the document referenced above.

## Design

The design decisions taken related to the brief are contained in the `docs` folder in the project. Links to these are provided here so as to keep the main README concise.

## Notes

## Screenshots

As part of the design & delivery process we are working closely with our business colleagues.
While the designers will provide mock-ups in tools like Figma, we have made it easy to show
the latest versions of approved screens.
They can be found in the [screenshots document](docs/screenshots.md)
