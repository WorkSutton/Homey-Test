## Background

In order to run locally we use Docker for development and testing. This allows new developers, qa's, and intereted parties to setup with minimial knowledge of the configuration and should allow operation of `Homey Test` application to be run on various OS's (Windows, Linux, MacOS).

The primary benefit of this is onboarding support should be related to docker and setup, vs various differences that typically exist when individuals choose an OS/Version that has not been tested with the application. It should reduce instances of `works on my machine`

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisite is that Docker is installed on your machine. It can be downloaded and installed from [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

N.B. Choose the OS of the machine that you want to install for, and follow the details in the docker documentation. Make sure if you are on a Apple Mac that you choose the correct architecture (new macs will use Apple Silicon)
