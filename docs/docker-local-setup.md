## Background

In order to run locally we use Docker for development and testing. This allows new developers, qa's, and intereted parties to setup with minimial knowledge of the configuration and should allow operation of `Homey Test` application to be run on various OS's (Windows, Linux, MacOS).

The primary benefit of this is onboarding support should be related to docker and setup, vs various differences that typically exist when individuals choose an OS/Version that has not been tested with the application. It should reduce instances of `works on my machine`

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisite is that Docker is installed on your machine. It can be downloaded and installed from [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

N.B. Choose the OS of the machine that you want to install for, and follow the details in the docker documentation. Make sure if you are on a Apple Mac that you choose the correct architecture (new macs will use Apple Silicon)

## Quirks/Learnings/Note(s) (to future self üë®‚Äçüíª)

Doing this task I started by developing in Docker - my preferred environment. 
I do this for a couple of reasons:
  - so as not to polute my machine (üëÄ at you Node JS)
  - to reduce the instances of `it doesn't work on my machine` due to environmental/setup differences

### Tailwind CSS with SimpleForm

This was a bit of a steep learning curve, initially the workaround was as follows:
- clone the `simple_form_tailwind_css`
- modify the relevant files
- figure out how to reference code that had all the `utility classes`. Needed to prevent references
  in the browser html code but missing styles upon inspection. This occurs when the `tree-shaking` 
  to purge the 10_000's of utility classes that are not used runs.
  It was complicated at first I thought by using Docker containers. After several fruitless hours on Friday afternoon I gave in. On the weekend I installed all the code necessary locally to have a functioning environment. LSS (Long Story Short ü´§) it turned out that the same issue existed. 
  Not having used Tailwind CSS before I had to do some fast reading. 
  It took most of a weekend to fix various issues then take them back to Docker environment to determine how to fix under containers. Learnt lots on the way.

  How to locate the tailwind exe - gems are stored in the docker volumes and mapped in the compose file
  `- gem_cache_homey_project_tracker:/gems`

#### How to compile / generate `./app/assets/builds/tailwind.css`
  1. use the run script to run the command in the container
  ```bash
  ./run cmd ash
  ```
  N.B. it's `ash` not bash/zsh/sh as the images are `Alpine Linux`
  2. confirm the location of the `exe`
  ```bash
  / # ls -lrt /gems/ruby/3.2.0/gems/tailwindcss-rails-2.0.29-x86_64-linux/exe/x86_64-linux/
  total 41116
  -rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root      42094864 Jun 15 09:48 tailwindcss
  ```
  3. run the command to read the relevant files and generate the output file via the build process
  ```bash
  /usr/src/app # /gems/ruby/3.2.0/gems/tailwindcss-rails-2.0.29-x86_64-linux/exe/x86_64-linux/tailwindcss -i ./app/assets/stylesheets/application.tailwind.css -o ./app/assets/builds/tailwind.css -c ./config/tailwind
  .config.js

  Rebuilding...

  Done in 356ms.
  ```
  N.B. Tailwind has various OS flavoured exe's so if on Mac OSX (intel or arm64) the gem will be different from above. This is well documented in the [tailwindcss-rails gem README](https://github.com/rails/tailwindcss-rails#using-a-local-installation-of-tailwindcss)

  The [simple_form_tailwind_css README section on `Tailwind JIT configuration`](https://github.com/abevoelker/simple_form_tailwind_css#tailwind-jit-configuration) lead me to believe that I should quickly be able to get all my styles so I could produce a [styled form and messages form as per these two images](https://github.com/abevoelker/simple_form_tailwind_css#default). How wrong was I given I had not worked with this before.

  The above - or so I thought - certainly the screens were telling me that!

  vs.

  4. make sure all files containing `tailwind` entries are included in `tailwind.config.js`
